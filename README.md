## Introduction

DMScrollViewStack is a UIScrollView subclass that efficently handles a vertical stack of multiple sub views/scrollviews.
With this class you can make a single scrollview composed by multiple views, tables or collection views without losing in performances or waste your deviceâ€™s memory.

A more detailed description of this class and how it works under the hood can be found in my blog's article here: ["How to efficiently handle a stack of scroll views in iOS"](http://danielemargutti.com/how-to-efficiently-handle-a-stack-of-scroll-views-in-ios/)

## Usage

Usage is pretty simple. You can use exposed methods to add or remove subviews. Subviews can be straight UIView or UIScrollView subclasses.

```
-setViews: // set a subview list (no animation)
-addSubview:animated:completion: // add subview at the bottom
-insertSubview:atIndex:animated:completion: // insert subview
-removeSubviewAtIndex:animated:completion: // remove subview
```

<div style="width:100%;">
<img src="Example/demo.gif" align="center" height="50%" width="50%" style="margin-left:20px;">
</div>



## Requirements
I've created it in iOS 8 but it should also works in previous iOS versions without changes.

## Installation

DMScrollViewStack is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "DMScrollViewStack"
